# Ghostty UX parity — open items

Living backlog for work **not** done yet (or deliberately deferred).  
Implemented spine: ground-truth fixtures → pure match → pure route → scoped executors.  
See [README.md](./README.md) for architecture and refresh procedure.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-22 (session: binding dispatch + performable + Linux table)

---

## Deferred (explicit)

### Font size (`⌘±` / `⌘0`)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Ghostty** | `increase_font_size` / `decrease_font_size` / `reset_font_size` → surface `setFontSize` |
| **Today** | Matched; **unhandled + consumed** (no effect) |
| **Why deferred** | Needs a **control-plane font/metrics protocol**, not just a keybind map |
| **What “font-size protocol” means** | New daemon↔renderer messages to change live `font_size_px` / cell W×H, reshape glyphs, recompute cols×rows, PTY resize. **Not** VT OSC and **not** CSS zoom alone. |
| **Touches** | `terminal-protocol`, `terminald` text-engine, session grid, React cell metrics (`CELL_WIDTH` / `LINE_HEIGHT` today fixed) |
| **Interim policy** | Keep unhandled consume so shell doesn’t see `=` / `-` / `0` with super |

Do **not** implement as canvas CSS zoom without grid/PTY update — that is not Ghostty parity.

### Search UI + bindings

| Bind (macOS) | Action | Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `⌘F` | `start_search` | performable → **pass-through** |
| `⌘E` | `search_selection` | pass-through |
| `⌘⇧F` / `Esc` | `end_search` | pass-through |
| `⌘G` / `⌘⇧G` | `navigate_search` | pass-through |

Needs search UI, scrollback search in core, and performable “search is open” state before consuming Escape again.

### Undo / redo (macOS)

| Bind | Action | Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `⌘Z` / `⌘⇧T` | `undo` | pass-through |
| `⌘⇧Z` | `redo` | pass-through |

Ghostty undo is limited (close/new tab/window/split) with timeout. Needs host stack of reverse ops — not just a keybind.

### Jump to prompt

| Bind (macOS) | Action | Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `⌘↑` / `⌘↓` | `jump_to_prompt:±1` | unhandled **consume** |
| `⌘⇧↑` / `⌘⇧↓` | same | consume |

Requires **shell integration** marks in terminald and a scroll-to-prompt API. No control message today.

### Write screen / scrollback / selection to file

| Bind (macOS) | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `⌘⇧⌃J` | `write_screen_file:copy` |
| `⌘⇧J` | `write_screen_file:paste` |
| `⌘⌥⇧J` | `write_screen_file:open` |

Needs temp-file export + clipboard/open-in-editor host actions.

### Inspector / command palette (product)

| Bind | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `⌘⌥I` | `inspector:toggle` | Ghostty terminal inspector; Electron equivalent TBD |
| `⌘⇧P` | `toggle_command_palette` | Could map to Ghosttea palette later |

### Quick terminal, secure input, float-on-top, etc.

Platform-native Ghostty features Electron cannot host 1:1. Track as **n/a** unless we invent product substitutes.

## Open (implementable without new daemon protocols)

These are smaller or host-only; still incomplete:

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Coverage matrix automation** | `coverage-matrix.json` drifts; should be generated from router + fixtures |
| **Linux table fidelity** | `keybinds-linux-default.json` is **derived** from `Config.zig`, not CLI dump (no Linux Ghostty binary in CI). Re-validate against `ghostty +list-keybinds --default` on Linux |
| **Win32** | Currently reuses Linux table; confirm vs Ghostty Windows defaults if/when supported |
| **`clear_screen`** | Still `\f` to PTY; may not match Ghostty clear/scrollback semantics |
| **`copy_to_clipboard` formats** | `plain` / `vt` / `html` / `mixed` ignored → plain text only |
| **`paste_from_selection`** | Collapsed to system paste on Electron |
| **`resize_split` units** | Ghostty px steps → fractional pane ratios (scaled by amount/10) |
| **Main-process edit claims** | Documented allowlist only; not generated from fixtures |
| **Swift chord table** | Still hand-rolled; TS is table-driven. Conformance fixture shared for workspace subset only |
| **Experiment app platform hooks** | Desktop has `openConfig` / `reloadConfig` / `closeAllWindows`; experiment app may lag |
| **Integration tests** | No React/Electron harness for capture vs surface scope partition |
| **Mouse / selection / clipboard goldens** | No Ghostty-aligned fixture suite yet (click/word/line, OSC 52, paste protection) |

---

## Implemented spine (do not regress)

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Ground truth extract + fixtures | macOS dump + Linux derived + extensions |
| Action parse/format (85 actions) | done |
| Trigger match + synthesize | done |
| Router: workspace / terminal / platform / unhandled | done |
| **Performable** pass-through for unhandled | Escape, search, undo, … |
| Terminal consume only if applied when performable | copy, adjust_selection, … |
| Workspace always consume after match | no fail-open PTY leak |
| Tabs / splits / zoom / equalize / close pane | done |
| Scroll family + adjust_selection + scroll-into-view | done |
| Natural text editing + paste | done |
| Platform: fullscreen, new/close window, quit, open/reload config, close all | done (desktop) |
| `last_tab` + `goto_tab` clamp to last | done (TS + Swift + Electron) |
| Platform-aware macOS vs Linux tables | done |
| ⌘⇧O remote sessions extension | **keep** (product) |

---

## Suggested priority when resuming

1. **Coverage matrix generator** from fixtures + `routeBindingAction` (cheap truth).  
2. **Linux CLI dump validation** on a Linux host.  
3. **Font-size protocol** (if product needs ⌘±).  
4. **Search** (if product needs ⌘F; re-enable Escape consume only when search open).  
5. **jump_to_prompt** after shell-integration marks.  
6. **Mouse/selection goldens**.  
7. **Swift table-driven chords** or shared fixture generation.

## Non-goals (parity)

- Pixel-identical Metal/GTK rendering  
- Quick terminal / layer-shell / macOS secure input API parity  
- Full Ghostty config surface on day one
