/**
 * The inputs that determine what the artifact contains.

 * The archive's own digests answer "are these the bytes we published". They
 * cannot answer "were these bytes built from the source we ship", because a
 * digest computed from a stale build agrees with a lock written from that same
 * stale build — the comparison is circular. That is not hypothetical: 0.6.2's
 * key-encoder and cursor fixes live in `ghostty_shim.c`, which compiles into
 * every slice, and every gate stayed green against the previous artifact.
 *
 * So the lock records a digest of these paths too, and the check recomputes it
 * from the working tree.
 *
 * The set covers only inputs whose staleness is *undetectable* by hashing the
 * archive: the Rust crates compiled into the core and font-fixture libraries, the
 * pins fixing the vendored Ghostty and libssh2 inputs, and the scripts that
 * compile and compose them.
 *
 * It deliberately omits the packaging and identity scripts, even though they
 * decide how the artifact is archived and digested. A change there is already
 * caught, and caught better: the checks re-derive the content digest and the
 * archive checksum from the published bytes, so altered archiving or digesting
 * makes the re-derived values disagree with the lock. Freshness only has to cover
 * what re-derivation cannot see. Keeping them out also keeps an edit to a comment
 * in this file from demanding a republish.
 *
 * A mismatch here means a republish, not merely a new field. The Apple build is
 * not byte-reproducible — measured, not assumed: recomposing identical sources on
 * one machine with one toolchain moved the archive by two bytes and changed its
 * content digest. So every rebuild is a new artifact under a new tag.
 *
 * Still conservative within that set: whole source trees are hashed, so a comment
 * or an inline `#[cfg(test)]` change in a compiled crate asks for a republish that
 * ships identical behaviour. That is the safe direction to err, and no textual
 * rule can separate a comment from code that matters.
