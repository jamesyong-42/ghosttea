//! A runnable compact host on loopback, for the cross-language interop run.
//!
//! Binds a real TCP listener on 127.0.0.1, serves one real PTY-backed session
//! through the real compact protocol stack, and runs until it is signalled. The
//! Swift client dials it over an ordinary socket, so the two implementations
//! meet as they would in production — minus the tailnet identity prologue,
//! which cannot run here and is documented at `serve_compact_loopback`.
//!
//! Everything a driver needs comes out on one line of stdout and nothing else
//! does, so the port and session id can be read without parsing prose.
