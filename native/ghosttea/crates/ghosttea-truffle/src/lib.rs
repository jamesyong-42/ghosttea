/// that cannot run without a tailnet. This skips exactly that prologue and
/// nothing else: `client_id` stands in for the WhoIs result, and every
/// connection is attributed to it. From the client hello onward — negotiation,
/// preface routing, attach, both multiplexed channels, the session control loop

/// path, over a real socket. So a run built on this proves the protocol and the
/// serve loop against a foreign client, and proves nothing about identity
/// binding, which stays covered only by the tailnet e2e.
///
/// Feature-gated: a compact endpoint that serves whoever connects, with the
/// identity check standing in rather than performed, is not something a

/// everything it owns with it, and a connection handler reads a closed
/// configuration publisher as a fault and hangs up — so a publisher owned here
/// would cut every live connection the instant this future is dropped, before
/// the drain could announce itself, turning a clean goodbye into what a viewer
